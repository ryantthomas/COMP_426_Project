# Dream Team Music Library

* Anyone trying to make a playlist

## What Problems Do We Solve?
* Classic music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora make music suggestions without user control. This app instead allows the user to quickly control their discovery of new artists by searching for suggestions directly without having to wait for automated suggestions.
* This App provides an atmosphere where people can discuss and recommend music to each other directly. Apps like Tik Tok and Spotify create a platform where people can share music with each other, but these platforms do not include a direct forum for recommending songs to people.
* User recommendations from leading music companies eventually become repetitive. Eventually, recommendations from apps like Spotify become repetitive and it becomes hard to find new music. With our app, this repetitive nature is eliminated because users can take charge of their recommendations outside of the control of an algorithm.
* Creating playlists last minute is now easy. Even on the most popular music apps, it can be hard to search through your favorite artists to create playlists and not miss at least a few good songs.  With our App; however, you save both your favorite artists and artists that are similar to them! This can improve user speed and ability in making new playlists.
