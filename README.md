## Our Audience
* Music lovers everywhere
* Particularly young people
* People who are tired of listening to the same music
* People who want to keep up with trends
* Anyone who wants to refine their music taste
* Anyone trying to make a playlist

## What Problems Do We Solve?
* Classic music apps like Spotify, Apple Music, and Pandora make music suggestions without user control. This app instead allows the user to quickly control their discovery of new artists by searching for suggestions directly without having to wait for automated suggestions.
* This App provides an atmosphere where people can discuss and recommend music to each other directly. Apps like Tik Tok and Spotify create a platform where people can share music with each other, but these platforms do not include a direct forum for recommending songs to people.
*User recommendations from leading music companies eventually become repetitive. Eventually, recommendations from apps like Spotify become repetitive and it becomes hard to find new music. With our app, this repetitive nature is eliminated because users can take charge of their recommendations outside of the control of an algorithm.
